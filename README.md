# Introduction
#### Rent prices of HDB flats in Singapore are influenced by many factors such as location, income levels, flat type, interest rates etc. Most people tend to make asusmptions that certain factors or conditions/situations affect rent prices but they do not verify these assumptions with actual data. In this submission, we are going to see some trends of key indicators against the trend of HDB rent prices. 


# Indicators
#### Some key indicators that we will explore are location, flat types, bank interest rates, income levels, foreigners in the workforce, unemployment rate and the resale prices of flats


# Findings
#### Based on the trending analysis, we can see that there is a clear distinction of rent prices between the different locations in Singapore. Some locations which are more centrally located command higher rent prices as compared to towns that are further away from the central area. There is also a clear difference in rent prices for the different room types as we expect; larger units tend to have higher rent prices in general. There is also an increasing trend of rent prices throughout the years for majority of the towns and flat types. This trend corresponds to the trend of the SORA as well, where the SORA has a steady increase from 2021 to 2023 and a slight dip in 2024. Similarly, the no. of taxpayers in the $80k and above tax bracket are on the rise and so are their assessable income. These higher income levels will allow more people to have the luxury of choice on choosing to rent a unit while waiting for the completion of their BTO flats or just simply to have a space they can call their own. The no. of Employment Pass and S Pass holders are on the uptrend as well (can be further confirmed when more data is released) and these workers tend to rent units instead of purchasing private properties which can be a big commitment. This will definitely contribute to the overall demand of HDB rental units. Unemployment rates are on the decline, opposite trending from rent prices and income levels. This means more people will be able to afford rental units. Average resale prices of flats in Singapore is on an upward trend; housing is getting more expensive. This can motivate people to apply for BTO flats instead and they may rent a unit while waiting for the completion of their BTO flats. On the other hand, there could be a group of people who cannot afford to purchase a resale flat or BTO flat and they may choose to rent in the short term while they gradually improve their financial situation. This will also drive up demand of rental units.


# Conclusion
#### A combination of factors affect rent prices of HDB flats in Singapore but one thing is for sure: as long as the economy continues to grow, rent prices will continue to increase.
